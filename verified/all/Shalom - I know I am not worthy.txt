I know I am not worthy
To come to You, my King,

To come before you and sing,
But You, in all Your mercy,
Forgive me, all my sins,
I want to thank You, Jesus,
You are my everything!

I need your help for that,
Please, help me to be thankful
For now and evermore! :/

But You, in all Your mercy,
Forgive me, all my sins,

You are my everything!
