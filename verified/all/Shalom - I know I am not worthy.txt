[v1]
I know I am not worthy
To come to You, my King,
I know I am not worthy
To come before you and sing,
But You, in all Your mercy,
Forgive me, all my sins,
I want to thank You, Jesus,
You are my everything!

You are Jesus, the One who set me free,
I want to serve You, Jesus,
I need your help for that,
Please, help me to be thankful
For now and evermore! :/

I know I am not worthy
To come to you, my King,
I know I am not worthy
To come before you and sing,
But You, in all Your mercy,
Forgive me, all my sins,
I want to thank You, Jesus,
You are my everything!
