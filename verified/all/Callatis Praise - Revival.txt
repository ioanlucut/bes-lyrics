[v1]
Lord, I am waiting for Your Spirit in my life,
Come abunde it with your presence everytime.
Lord, I’m coming in Your Name, Lord, let revival’s flame.
Change all that we are and release your power,
Fill our lives and hearts
Here, we’re waiting, revive our lives.

[c]
Revival, send revival,
Bring revival to each one of us,
Revive our lives.

[v2]
Lord, I will leave my heart and spirit
In Your hands,
All my life time close to You
I want to spend,
Drive me to a secret place.
